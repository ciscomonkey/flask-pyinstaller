# flask-pyinstaller

Just my notes on creating standalone flask app using pyinstaller for some projects I am working on.

# Setup

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ciscomonkey/flask-pyinstaller.git .
$ pip install pyinstaller flask
```

# Normal build command:

```shell
$ pyinstaller --onefile --add-data 'templates:templates' --add-data 'static:static' normal_flaskapp.py
```

# What fails with this?

When you pull up http://localhost:5000/ you'll get a server error and on the console you'll see:

```shell
~/dev/cflask/dist$ ./normal_flaskapp
 * Serving Flask app "normal_flaskapp" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off

Don't run it as ```./build/normal_flaskapp``` as this puts the templates folder in the relative path where Flask expects to see them. When you distribute your standalone executable, those folders won't be there and you'll see the error from above.

# How to fix?

The problem is that when the site is running in packaged form, the templates are inside
a directory called _MEIxxxxxx under the temp directory (see https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/runtime-information.html#using-file) and you have to tell Flask about this.

To do this use the template_folder argument (see http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#application-object).

Finally, the if clause is there to ensure that we can still use it unpackaged during development.

This is in ```single_flaskapp.py```

```python
import os
import sys
from flask import Flask

if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
    template_folder = os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, 'templates')
    static_folder = os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, 'static')
    app = Flask(__name__, template_folder=template_folder, static_folder=static_folder)
else:
    app = Flask(__name__)
```

Then we just build the app for the ```single_flaskapp.py``` with the command:  
```shell
$ pyinstaller --onefile --add-data 'templates:templates' --add-data 'static:static' single_flaskapp.py
```


Now when we run:

```shell
~/dev/cflask/dist$ ./single_flaskapp

 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
